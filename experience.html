		      	So you want to know if I know what I'm doing in <em>Tech</em>? The answer is somewhat. Long ago in a house far far away I learned some HTML by myself, fast forward a few years and I am now in Com-Sci. I recall some stuff from before, but mainly, I'm relearning almost everything. But not to worry, I'm a quick learner

	      	I once created a Snake game with JavaScript and one with Python.
	      	I once ran an online comic book viewer that had handmade comics, under different names ofcourse. My friend E.A. and I created the website, while our silent partner and friend C.N. funded us while also providing ideas. We used HTML and CSS heavily as our content was decent and not a best seller, but if people liked our website layout and style, they would remember us for our colour. With the comics we created and posted we made some revenue, but eventually our business ran dry. But it was fun while it lasted.
	      	<br></br>
	      	There are other times I helped out in website creation, maintainence, and correcting.
	      	I also was once part of my middle school Robotics Team, my middle school being the <big>The Valleys Senior S.S.<big>.
